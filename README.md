# Universe-Expansion
Computational Physics Project. Master in Theoretical Physics (AMU).

traceur.py is the visualization module.

solver_analyse.py and solver_num.py simulate the expansion of high vacuum spherical spaces using newtonian gravity, both analyticaly and computationaly.

solver_dark_energy.py simulates the same things using the lambda-cdm model.
